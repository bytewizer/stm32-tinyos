# TinyOS Build System

TinyOS is a open-source [.NET runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) platform based on OpenEmbedded and optimized for IoT devices. 

TinyOS Linux is built around busybox and systemd. This makes it small and very resource efficient. A deployment requires no more than 8 MB memory and a installation to disk requires around 200 MB of storage. Devices typically take about 12 seconds to boot with networking.

You can [download](https://github.com/bytewizer/stm32-tinyos/releases) prebuilt images or fully build a flashable image from source with the following commands, but be careful it will take several hours:

NOTE: THESE IMAGES ARE BETA AND AT THIS POINT DO NOT INCLUDED ANY SECURITY HARDENING. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

## Give a Star! :star:

If you like or are using this project to start your solution, please give it a star. Thanks!

## Clone the Repository

If you haven't set a global git name and email yet, adapt the following git config commands to your information. (This is required to clone some git repositories when building.)

```bash
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

Clone the main repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bytewizer/stm32-tinyos.git
```

Before you continue to build, make sure you're in the stm32-tinyos directory:
```bash
cd stm32-tinyos
./run-build.sh install
./run-build.sh init
```

Build TinyOS
```bash
./run-build.sh
```

## Using Visual Studio Code to modify the project
```bash
cd stm32-tinyos
code stm32-tinyos.code-workspace
```

## Using minicom command to connect via console
```bash
minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
```

# Licenses

A TinyOS image is made of many components and itâ€™s hard to describe the full details of all the licenses that are in use in the system. However, when building the system from sources with OpenEmbedded, one can find the exhaustive set of licenses used by each package in the `build/tmp/deploy/licenses` directory.
